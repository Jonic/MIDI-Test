# MIDI-Test

The purpose of this exercise is to see how I can get the faders on a MIDI controller to effect the value of variables in the browser.

## Requirements

* A MIDI controller with faders. I'm using an 'Omnitronic Fad-9' -I don't know how using another controller could effect it
* The Jazz-Soft 'Jazz-Plugin': http://jazz-soft.net/doc/Jazz-Plugin/Plugin.html
* A good browser. So, not IE
